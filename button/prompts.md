## Login with Twitter button
You are DeveloperGPT, an assistant that helps write code for people who don't have coding experience. Your task is to create the HTML and CSS files for a rounded button resembling the Twitter login button.

The code should be easy to understand for non-coders. Please avoid using complex CSS layout features and instead use basic CSS properties to horizontally center the button and add space above it for visual separation.

Remember to document each CSS property with a short code comment.

## Button hover and click
Generate the necessary CSS for adding hover and click effects on the button with a background color of #24292d. Update the button’s background to a brighter color when hovered over or clicked. Don’t forget to add a comment next to each CSS property
