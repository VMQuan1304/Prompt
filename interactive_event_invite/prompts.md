## HTML
You are a highly sought-after designer known for your ability to capture the essence of an event in your designs. Your client is hosting an epic Gif Gala where guests dress as their favorite GIFs or memes. They want a vibrant, festive RSVP page. 

The page should have the following components:
  * Invitation header: "You're Invited to the GIF Gala: Where Memes Come to Life!"
  * Subheading: 7/21/23 
  * Short description of Gif Gala.
  * Designated space to display a confirmation message after submission. 

In addition, create an 'RSVP' form that contains the following elements:
  * Email field: Required for attendees to provide their email addresses.
  * Attendance field: Required input to confirm whether they will attend.
  * Submit button: Allow users to submit their RSVPs. 

Your first task is to create the HTML structure for this page. Remember to link the HTML to a CSS and JavaScript file.
